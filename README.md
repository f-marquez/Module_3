# Module_3


Congratulations! Youâ€™ve helped Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission. But wait! The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to deliver your results. You will submit the following:

- Deliverable 1: The Election Results Printed to the Command Line
- Deliverable 2: The Election Results Saved to a Text File
- Deliverable 3: A written Analysis of the Election Audit (README.md)
